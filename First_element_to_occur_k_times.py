# First element to occur k times

# Given an array of n integers. Find the first element that 
# occurs atleast k number of times. If no such element exists 
# in the array, then expect the answer to be -1.

# Example 1:

# Input :
# n = 7, k = 2
# a[] = {1, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8, 7}
# Output :
# 4
# Explanation :
# Both 7 and 4 occur 2 times. But 4 is first that occurs twice.
# As at index = 4, 4 has occurred twice whereas 7 appeared twice
# at index 6.
# Example 2:

# Input :
# n = 10, k = 3
# a[] = {3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 3, 3, 5, 4}
# Output :
# 3
# Explanation :
# Here, 3 is the only number that appeared atleast 3 times in the array.
# Your Task:  
# You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete
# the function firstElementKTime() which takes the array a[], its size n, 
# and an integer k as input arguments and returns the required answer. If 
# the answer is not present in the array, return -1.

# Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
# Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n).


class Solution:
    def firstElementKTime(self, n, k, a):
        
        track=[0 for _ in range(max(a)+1)]
        
        for i in a:
            if track[i]+1==k:
                return i
            else:
                track[i]+=1
        
        return -1
